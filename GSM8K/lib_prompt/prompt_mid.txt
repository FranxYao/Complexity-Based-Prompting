Question: In 5 years, Heath will be 3 times as old as Jude.  If Heath is 16 years old today, how old is Jude today?
Let's think step by step
In 5 years, Heath will be 16 + 5 = 21 years old.
In 5 years, Jude will be 21 / 3 = 7 years old.
The difference in their ages is 21 - 7 = 14 years.
Today, Jude will be 16 - 14 = 2 years old.
The answer is 2

Question: Mancino is tending 3 gardens that each measure 16 feet by 5 feet. His sister, Marquita, is tilling the soil for two gardens that each measure 8 feet by 4 feet. How many square feet combined are in all their gardens?
Let's think step by step
3 * (16 * 5) = 240 square feet
2 * (8 * 4) = 64 square feet
240 + 64 = 304 square feet
The gardens have a total of 304 square feet.
The answer is 304

Question: Bridge and Sarah have $3 between them. If Bridget has 50 cents more than Sarah, how many cents does Sarah have?
Let's think step by step
Let X be the amount of money Sarah has, so Bridget has X + 50 cents
We know that Sarah and Bridget combined have $3, or 300 cents, so X + X + 50 = 300
We therefore know that 2X = 250
So Sarah has 250 / 2 = 125 cents
The answer is 125

Question: Ben has four boxes with ten basketball cards in each box. His mother gave him five boxes with eight baseball cards.  If he gives 58 cards to his classmates, how many cards does he has left?
Let's think step by step
Ben has 4 x 10 = 40 basketball cards.
His mother gave him 5 x 8 = 40 baseball cards.
Thus, Ben has 40 + 40 = 80 cards in all.
Therefore, Ben has 80 - 58 = 22 cards left.
The answer is 22

Question: Lulu has $65 in her piggy bank. She spent $5 on ice cream. She then spent half of the remainder of the money on a t-shirt. Afterwards, she went to the bank and deposited a fifth of her remaining money. How much cash was Lulu left with?
Let's think step by step
Lulu had 65-5 = 60 dollars left after eating ice cream.
Lulu had 60/2 = 30 dollars left.
Lulu deposited 30/5 = 6 dollars
Lulu was left with 30-6 = 24 in cash.
The answer is 24

Question: Kim orders a $10 meal and a drink for 2.5.  She gives a 20% tip.  She pays with a $20 bill.  How much does she get in change?
Let's think step by step
The dinner cost 10+2.5=$12.5.
The tip comes to 12.5*.2=$2.5.
So the total cost is 12.5+2.5=$15.
That means she gets 20-15=$5 in change.
The answer is 5

Question: A gallon of whole milk that normally costs $3 is now sold at $2. A box of cereal was sold at a discount of $1. How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?
Let's think step by step
The discount for each gallon of whole milk is $3 - $2 = $1.
So the discount for 3 gallons of whole milk is $1/gallon x 3 gallons = $3.
The total discount for 5 boxes of cereal is $1/box x 5 boxes = $5.
You will save $3 + $5 = $8 for 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal.
The answer is 8

Question: There are 32 students in a statistics course.  25 percent of the class received an A.  1/4 of the remaining students got either a B or C, and the rest of the students failed.  How many students failed?
Let's think step by step
A grade:32(.25)=8
32-8=24 students remaining
B/C grade:24/4=6
24-6=18 students fail
The answer is 18
