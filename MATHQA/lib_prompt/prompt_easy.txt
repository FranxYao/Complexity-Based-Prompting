12 * 10 + 30 = 150.
( 30 / 130 ) * 100 = 23.1
The answer is c, 23.1 %

Question: the ratio of three numbers is 1 : 3 : 4 and the sum of their squares is 2600 . the sum of the numbers is ?
Options: a ) 10 , b ) 12 , c ) 15 , d ) 14 , e ) 9
Let's think step by step
let the numbers be x , 3 x , 4 x then , x^2 + 9x^2 + 16x^2 = 2600
26 x^2 = 2600, x^2 = 100, x = 10
The answer is a, 10

Question: the average weight of 8 person ' s increases by 1.5 kg when a new person comes in place of one of them weighing 75 kg . what might be the weight of the new person ?
Options: a ) 81 kg , b ) 85 kg , c ) 90 kg , d ) 100 kg , e ) 110 kg

weight of new person = ( 75 + 6 ) kg = 81 kg.
The answer is a, 81 kg

Question: how many positive integers less than 60 have a reminder 01 when divided by 3 ?
Options: a ) 13 , b ) 14 , c ) 15 , d ) 16 , e ) 20
Let's think step by step

Question: 8 is 2 % of a , and 2 is 8 % of b . c equals b / a . what is the value of c ?
Options: a ) 1 / 16 , b ) 1 / 4 , c ) 1 , d ) 4 , e ) 8
Let's think step by step
2a / 100 = 8, a = 400
8b / 100 = 2, b = 25
c = b / a = 25 / 400 = 1 / 16
The answer is a, 1 / 16

Question: the membership of a committee consists of 3 english teachers , 4 mathematics teachers , and 2 social studies teachers . if 2 committee members are to be selected at random to write the committee ’ s report , what is the probability that the two members selected will both be maths teachers ?
Options: a ) 2 / 3 , b ) 1 / 3 , c ) 2 / 9 , d ) 1 / 24 , e ) 1 / 12
Let's think step by step
probability of first member an english teacher = 3 / 9
probability of second member an english teacher = 2 / 8
probability of both being english teacher = 3 / 9 x 2 / 8 = 1 / 12
The answer is e, 1 / 12

Question: the radius of a cylindrical vessel is 7 cm and height is 5 cm . find the whole surface of the cylinder ?
Options: a ) 281 , b ) 528 , c ) 440 , d ) 767 , e ) 1981
Let's think step by step
r = 7, h = 5
2 π r ( h + r ) = 2 * 22 / 7 * 7 ( 12 ) = 528
The answer is b, 528
